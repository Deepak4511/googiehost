            <p>In the early 2010s, Rajesh Chauhan wanted to start his online journey and make a name for himself, but the cost of a domain and web hosting skyrocketed, and an ordinary man could not afford it. But, Rajesh Chauhan took the challenge and decided to make web hosting & new domain registration affordable for an average person. In the summer of 2012, Rajesh founded GoogieHost, which offers 1GB NVMe SSD Storage and 100GB Bandwith without any cost.</p>

            <h1 class="entry-title mb-4 fw-bold">It's All About Customers</h1>
            <p>The GooigeHost ran into many problems with the domain issues with search engine giant Google because GoogieHost sounds like Google hosting, but Google decided to let the web hosting company continue. The GoogieHost had a decent amount of paid users on the platform, but the Blogger Rajesh Chauhan made it a free web hosting platform. The company became a non-profit organisation ever since, and they don’t sell advertisements, they don’t sell your information, and they don’t force you to upgrade to premium.</p>
