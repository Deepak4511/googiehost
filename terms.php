            <h2>6. ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE</h2>
            <p>Sites must use appropriate server resources, including bandwidth, processor utilization, and disk space.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge that GoogieHost may establish general practices and limits regarding the use of the Service, such as the maximum number of days that idle hosting accounts, message board postings, or other uploaded Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum number of email messages that may be sent from or received by an account on the Service, the total size of any email message that may be shipped from or acquired by a report on the Service, the entire disk space that will be allotted on GoogieHost’s servers on your behalf, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you may access the Service in a given time.

            <h2>Script Usage Terms</h2>
            <p>Scripts on the GoogieHost site should be intended to create web-based Content and not to function as an application server. Activities that are not allowed include using the server to generate large volumes of emails from a database or attempting to manipulate server timeouts. Sites that reset these are resource-intensive and adversely affect</p>
            <p>server performance and are, therefore, not allowed. Scripts that provide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>
            <p>The primary purpose of any script should be to produce a web page. Good scripts send a single email based on user-entered information or update a database. Scripts that send bulk emails or perform processor-intensive database processes are not allowed.</p>
            <p>All outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a GoogieHost-hosted domain.</p>
            <p>Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources or other sites on the same server.</p>
            <h2>Disk Space Usage Terms</h2>
            <p>GoogieHost offers ample web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean space for legitimate website content and bandwidth for visitors to view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website and linked to the site. Sites should not contain backups, downloads, or other non-web-based content. We will treat all password-protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this content are not permitted.</p>
            <p>Archives of movie files, audio files, zips, rars or large volumes of files used for downloading/sharing are not allowed on GoogieHost.</p>
            <h2>Maximum Website Host Per Person</h2>
            <p>A maximum of three websites is allowed per individual. Hosting additional websites beyond this limit is regarded as abuse and will lead to the termination of all websites without any prior notice. Please make sure to adhere to this policy to avoid any inconvenience. Note that we reserve the right to modify this policy at any time without prior notice.</p>

            <h2>GoogieHost Lifetime Hosting Terms</h2>
            <p>We have crafted Shared Hosting plans based on the analysis of over 10,000 customers on GoogieHost. We have allocated enough resources to host basic low-traffic websites on your hosting account without requiring you to spend hundreds of dollars annually.</p>
            <p>One-time Payment:LTD Plans don’t require any annual renewal of your hosting account.</p>
            <p>Free vs. LTD Hosting:Our LTD Hosting servers differ from free plans, and the software technologies are far superior to those on the free platform.</p>
            <p>FUP Policies:Like other premium hosting brands, we impose FUP limitations on server resources to keep the server stable and ensure optimal performance for all hosted websites and applications. We reserve the right to increase or decrease server resources based on performance.

                For internal security reasons, we do not publicly share information about I/O limits, daily email limits, number of connections, or EP limits.</p>
            <h2>What Does LTD Mean?</h2>
            <p>At GoogieHost, we consider hosting plans valid for more than three years as a Lifetime Deal. We are committed to offering you service for at least three years. After that period, based on factors like server health, investments, and other considerations, we may decide to discontinue the server or ask for a renewal of the plan you opted for. In the hosting industry, people typically spend at least $50 per year to host a single website with a reputable hosting provider. We are committed to offering you the same level of service for three years.</p>
            <h3>Inactive Account Removal</h3>
            <p>All LTD Plans fall under the IAR Policy. Like free hosting accounts, LTD plans must remain active. We follow this policy to ensure the server stays in optimal condition and to free up unused resources.</p>
            <h3>How We Check Inactivity:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We check DNS to see if the domain is pointing to our server.</li>
                <li>We review traffic received within the past 45 days.</li>
                <li>We ensure hosted data is related to the website only.</li>
                <li>We analyze the access log of your hosting account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If our system detects inactivity, we reserve the right to suspend the account and remove it from our platform 15 days after suspension.</p>
